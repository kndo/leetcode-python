# LeetCode Python Solutions
This repo contains my Python solutions to LeetCode problems. I try to give ample
documentation to maximize the pedagogy of my solutions, including time and space
complexity and how I arrive at them.

For expediency, when problems involve an array, I am OK with using a Python list
instead and using the following operations:
- `for i in range(n):` to iterate over indexes
-  `for i in range(bigger, smaller, -1):` to iterate backwards
- `for num in nums:` to iterate over values
- `for i, num in enumerate(nums):` to iterate over indexes and values simultaneously
- `nums[-1]` to get the last element

While these operations are indeed Pythonic, they don't fundamentally provide any
extra functionality over a low-level array. No shortcuts are intentionally
made to evade the topic(s) or data structure(s) that the question is testing.

I very much welcome suggestions and corrections. Thanks.
