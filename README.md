# LeetCode Python Solutions
This repo contains my Python solutions to LeetCode problems. I try to give ample
documentation to maximize the pedagogy of my solutions, including time and space
complexity and how I arrived at them.

For expediency, when problems involve an array, I am OK with using a Python list
instead and using the following operations:
- `for i in range(n)` to iterate over the list
-  `for i in range(bigger, smaller, -1)` to iterate backwards
- `nums[-1]` to get the last element

While these operations are indeed Pythonic, they don't provide any extra
functionality as compared to a low-level array. No short-cuts are intended.

I very much welcome corrections. Thanks.
